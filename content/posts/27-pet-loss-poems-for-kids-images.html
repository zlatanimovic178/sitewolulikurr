                I could see that you grant me the strength not to dwell on my loss. I have found my words of sympathy have struck a cord with so many grieving the loss of a pet, whether dealing with the death of a dog or a cat. It made me think that perhaps letting children make a tribute to their pet, perhaps a poem, note, scrapbook, or homemade book, would be.

    <h3>I have found my words of sympathy have struck a cord with so many grieving the loss of a pet, whether dealing with the death of a dog or a cat.</h3>
    <p>These are much longer and more in depth poems. It is true nothing can ease the ache. Rainbow bridge is a lovely prose poem written for anyone who&#039;s suffered the loss of a beloved pet. I wrote pawprints left by you, a pet loss poem, after my husband and i lost our first baby.</p>
