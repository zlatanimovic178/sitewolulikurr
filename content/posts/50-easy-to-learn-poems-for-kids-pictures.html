    <h3>Poems give children an easy way to remember a lesson or value.</h3>
    <p>Poems capture emotions and ideas in lyrical phrases that are often easy to i know from firsthand experience that finding the right poetry for kids can be a difficult task. Introduced in the right way at the right time, poems can be magical for children.
