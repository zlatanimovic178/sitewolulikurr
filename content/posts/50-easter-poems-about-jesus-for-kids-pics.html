                We must always follow the love jesus showed and all of the things that he said. Tuck a poem into a plastic egg with a few jelly beans or include it in a card brand new clothes and a freshly washed face, going to church to give thanks for god&#039;s grace. I always wondered why jesus sends bunnies on easter to deliver all of his gifts to every child in the world, and then it occurred to meâ€”bunnies are like little.
    </p>

    <h3>When jesus came on the scene he came in a way that was humble here on earth he never mumbled nor grumbled.</h3>
    <p>Poems for kids are conceptualized in a unique way, either carrying colorful designs or rhymes. Jesus loves everyone (tune of pop goes the weasel). Short spring poem for primary school. So hold them and turn them.</p>
